# functors-monads

**Functors** and **monads from adjunctions**.

* functor.v - functor and adjunction classes and some basic instances.

* monad.v - monads in terms of return/join and return/bind, and
  construction of monads from adjunctions.

In the end we get the state monad without ever defining it explicitly
:D (from the adjunction of the reader and product functors).
